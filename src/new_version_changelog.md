#Added !campfire command
#!campfire - just output campfire rates
#!campfire <meat count> - calculate how much time and fuel would you need to cooks so much meat or fish (yeah I know about different rates for mutton but I'm too lazy)
#!campfire <meat count> <campfire count> - same as above but now we have servial campfires so it would be faster
